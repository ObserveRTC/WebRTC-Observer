# Introduction

WebRTC-Observer is a microservice written in Java to collect and analyze 
measurements originated by WebRTC Applications. It is designed to be a 
monitoring solution for WebRTC Applications scalable 
from a single, local development up to a large kubernetes cluster.  

This document is written for version [hydrogen](https://github.com/ObserveRTC/observer/releases/tag/hydrogen)


# Architecture

![Architecture](architecture.png)

In our architectural model, the observer takes place as a 
processing element, capable of accepting samples from the 
collecting components, and can forward reports to a Data Sink.

You can read a detailed description about the architecture 
in our [main](http://observertc.org) page.

The service is written in Java, using [micronaut](https://micronaut.io) 
framework to implement the observer business logic, 
and [hazelcast](https://hazelcast.org) in-memory-data-grid is used 
to share data between service components, and instances.


# Incoming samples

## Services

## Media Units

### Mappings

# Application Programming Interfaces (API)

The observer is responsible to provide interfaces for the following operations:

* Accept samples
* Provide metrics
* Forward reports

## Accept Samples

THe service can listen for samples on various 
inputs (e.g. websocket server), and samples are accepted if 
the invoked input validate the provided sample.

The following schemas are accepted as inputs:
 * [Peer Connection Samples](###peer-connection-sample)


### Peer Connection Sample

The peer connection sample multiplexes 
webrtc stats metrics, client details, and user media informations.

Clients providing Peer Connection Samples: 
 * [observer-js](https://github.com/ObserveRTC/observer-js)

#### Version: 20200114

 * [Schema description](pcsample-v20200114.md)
 * [Json Schema]()


### Sample Listeners

#### Websockets

Schema: [Peer Connection Sample](#peer-connection-sample) **Version**: 20200114:
 * ws(s)://{HOST}:{PORT}/{serviceUUID}/{mediaUnitId}/v20200114/json

## Provided Metrics

The observer monitors the incoming samples and expose metrics.
The metrics are exposed using [micrometer](https://micrometer.io/) plugin in
[micronaut](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-micrometer/latest/guide/index.html#introduction)
framework.

### Integrations


All integration with the supported
metrics' server is possible via a proper micronaut configuration, which
is part of the observer (or observer part of micronaut it is a matter
of perspective).

The default integration this version is compiled is the [prometheus](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-micrometer/latest/guide/index.html#prometheus)
integration.

### General Metrics

General metrics are enabled by default, and provides an overall state of the service.

# Reference Configuration

The following configuration serves as a reference configuration
for this version in `yaml` format with comments
explaining (more or less) what that configuration is intended
to setup.

The configuration must be parsed by the service engine framework
([micronaut](https://micronaut.io)), thus it should be placed
one of the config file it loads (e.g.: `application.yaml`).
